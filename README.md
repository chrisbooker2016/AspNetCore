### What is ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core is a new open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud based internet connected applications, such as web apps, IoT apps and mobile backends. ASP.NET Core apps can run on .NET Core or on the full .NET Framework. It was architected to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac and Linux. ASP.NET Core is open source at GitHub.

### Why build ASP.NET Core?

The first preview release of ASP.NET came out almost 15 years ago as part of the .NET Framework. Since then millions of developers have used it to build and run great web apps, and over the years we have added and evolved many capabilities to it.

ASP.NET Core has a number of architectural changes that result in a much leaner and modular framework. ASP.NET Core is no longer based on System.Web.dll. It is based on a set of granular and well factored NuGet packages. This allows you to optimize your app to include just the NuGet packages you need. The benefits of a smaller app surface area include tighter security, reduced servicing, improved performance, and decreased costs in a pay-for-what-you-use model.

### With ASP.NET Core you gain the following foundational improvements:

+ A unified story for building web UI and web APIs
+ Integration of modern client-side frameworks and development workflows
+ A cloud-ready environment-based configuration system
+ Built-in dependency injection
+ New light-weight and modular HTTP request pipeline
+ Ability to host on IIS or self-host in your own process
+ Built on .NET Core, which supports true side-by-side app versioning
+ Ships entirely as NuGet packages
+ New tooling that simplifies modern web development
+ Build and run cross-platform ASP.NET apps on Windows, Mac and Linux
+ Open source and community focused
